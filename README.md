## Project Overview

This repository is structured to guide you through the main aspects of Python programming in a hands-on manner. You‚Äôll find exercises for control structures, functions, data handling, and more. Each section builds upon previous knowledge, allowing you to grow progressively in both coding ability and confidence.

## Requirements

To run the exercises in this repository, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Python 3.6+**: This repository is compatible with Python version 3.6 and higher. You can download the latest version of Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **Git** (optional, for cloning): If you'd like to clone this repository directly, ensure Git is installed on your system. [Download Git here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
- **Text Editor or IDE**: Use any text editor like VS Code, PyCharm, or Jupyter Notebook to edit and run the Python scripts.

To verify that Python is installed, open a terminal and run:
```bash
python --version
```

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine using Git, and navigate into the directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alexhl005/python-learning-exercises.git
cd python-learning-exercises
```

If you don‚Äôt have Git, you can also download the ZIP version of the repository from GitHub and extract it on your computer.

## Usage

Once you've cloned or downloaded the repository, you can navigate through the directories to explore and run each exercise. Each folder is organized by topic, making it easy to follow along and pick exercises based on your level and learning goals.

To run a Python file, use the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python path/to/your/file.py
```

For instance:
```bash
python primeros-ej/hello_world.py
```

Feel free to modify and experiment with the code to get a deeper understanding of each concept.

## Exercise Categories

Below are the main categories of exercises included in this repository:

### üßë‚Äçüíª Basic Examples
- **primeros-ej/**: Get started with introductory exercises focused on basic syntax, data types, and simple operations.

### üîÑ Control Structures
- **condicionales/**: Practice with conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`), and learn how to control the flow of your programs.
- **for/** and **whiles/**: Learn about loops with `for` and `while`, and build a foundation in iteration techniques.

### üõ†Ô∏è Functions & Modularization
- **funciones/**: Exercises to define functions, use parameters, handle return values, and understand the power of modular code.

### üìã Data Structures
- **lista/**: Work with lists through exercises that cover indexing, slicing, common list methods, and list comprehensions.
- **tuplas/**: Learn about tuples, their immutability, and typical use cases where they can be useful in data handling.

### ‚úçÔ∏è String Manipulation
- **cadenas/**: Dive into string handling, covering basic operations, string methods, concatenation, and text processing.

### üìñ Dictionaries
- **diccionarios/**: Explore the power of dictionaries with exercises focused on creating key-value pairs, accessing values, updating data, and using dictionary methods. Learn practical use cases such as frequency counts, data grouping, and nested dictionaries.

Each category includes exercises with various levels of difficulty, making this repository suitable for both beginners and those looking to reinforce their Python skills.
